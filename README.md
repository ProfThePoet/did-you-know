Hello World!

Did you know that I have finally joined the trend of Github? 
Ok, now you know. 

I am here to learn though. And hopefully to earn (smiles). 
Meanwhile, I am a computer programmer majoring in web development, game design and sofware design.
I am a poet, writer, publisher, editor, activist, and a public speaker.

Can someone welcome me here please?
